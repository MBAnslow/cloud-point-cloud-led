 * its `position` only controls the direction — moving it closer or
 * farther has no effect on brightness. We instead apply a softened
 * inverse-square falloff based on the light's distance to the origin so
 * the panel's `distance` slider does something visible.
 *
 *   atten(d) = REF² / (REF² + d²)        with REF = 5
 *
 * At the default light position (≈ 5.4 from origin) this is ≈ 0.46, so
 * sliding the distance lower brightens up to ≈ 1.0, and sliding higher
 * dims toward 0. Both the custom LED shading and the three.js light
 * that shades the (translucent) ellipsoid mesh use this same multiplier
 * so the two views stay consistent.
